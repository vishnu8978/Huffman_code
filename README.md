Overview : This code implements huffman coding using C++.Huffman coding is one of the popular data compression technique
          which used to reduce the size of data without affecting actual information,moreover it assigns shorter binary codes 
          for most frequently repeated characters and assigns large binary code for less fequently repeated characters.

          From given characters and their frequencies this program will build a huffman tree, by performing pre-order traversal 
          it generates huffman code for each single character.
